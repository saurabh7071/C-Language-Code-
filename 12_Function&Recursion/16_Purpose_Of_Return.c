		What is the main purpose of return in programming languages ? 
		
		
	-->		'C' does not specify any return type for the main function 
	
	-->		In 'C++' the main function return a value of type int to the operating system.
	
	-->		Return is used at the end of the function if there is an returned value. 
	
	-->		AS i said the main returns the value of type int to the operating system....
			This returned value is called "Exit value"
			
	-->		If the exit value is "0" then the program will compile successfully...
			otherwise if it is '1' then it will show error..
			
	-->		So Finally we can say that the operating system test the return value, called exit
			value to determine if any problem in the code...
			
	-->		Return 0 indicate that program has complete successfully...
			and
			Return 1 indicate that program has a error

						Loop :- 
						
	Loops are used to repeat similar part of code snippet efficiently.
	
	
	>>> Why Loops :- 
					Sometimes we used our programs to execute few set of instructions 
					over and over again.
					
					Ex : Printing 1 to 100 , first 100 even numbers etc.
					
					Hence Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell computer that a
					given set of instructions must be executed repetetively..
					
					
	>>> Types of Loops :-
						  Primarily, there are three types of loops in c language.
						  1) While Loop
						  2) do-while Loop
						  3) For Loop
						  
	
	1) While Loop    :- Checks the condition & then executes the code.
	2) Do-While Loop :- a) executes the code & then checks the condition.
	 					b) Do-While Loop which executes at least once.

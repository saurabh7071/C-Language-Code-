   ** Variables :- 
   					A variables is a container which stores a 'value'.
   					
   				-->	Variable is the name of a memory location which stores some data...
   					
   					        In kitchen,we have containers storing Rice,Dal,Sugar etc.
			 					similarly variables in c stores value of a constant.
   					
					   OR
					   
					   A Variable is an entity whose value can be changed.
					   Ex :  
					   		int age = 18;
					   		 
					   		age = 20; 
					   
			
					   
   			 Ex :-  int age= 18;             // age is assigned "18"
   					float pi =3.14;          // pi is assigned "3.14"
   					char hashtag ='#'        // hashtag is assigned '#'
   					 		
   
   ** Types of Variables :- 
   		1) Integer Variables :-   int a=2;
   		2) Real Variables :-      float a=2.6;       -> int a=2.6 is wrong .....
   		3) Character Variables :- char a='Saurabh';
   		
   		
   		
   ** Rules for Naming variables in c :-
   		1) First character must be an alphabet or underscore(_).
		2) No commas,blanks allowed.
		3) No special symbol other than underscore (_) allowed.
		4) Variables names are case sensitive. 
				We must create meaningfull Variables names in our programs.
				
		--> Variable ka name hamesha meaningfull hona chahiye jisse ye jaldi se ye pata chale ki hum kya values store kar 
				rahe hai.....
				
						
	** Constants :- 
					An entity whose value does'nt change is called as a constant.
					
		Types of Constants :- 
							  1) Integer Constants :-  -1,3,5,6.
							  2) Real Constants :-     -333.2,2.5,3.0
							  3) Character Constant :-  'a','$','@'
							  						  (Must be enclosed within single 
														inverted commas)
														
	** Keywords :- 
					These are reserved words,whose meaning is already know to the compiler.
					
						There are 32 keywords available in c....
							
				auto        double        if          struct																
				break 		else          long		  switch					
				Case        enum          return      type deff
				Char        extern        register    union
				Const       float         short       unsigned
				Continue    for           signed      void
				default     goto          size of     voletile
				do		    int           static	  While	
				
	Keywords and Datatypes :- 
							Keywords are the reserved words in a programming language. 
							They cannot be used as a variable name inside of your 
							program
							
							Datatypes are keyword which difine what type of data a 
							particular variable can hold.
